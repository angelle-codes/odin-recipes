    <p>How to make pretty southern pecan pralines</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 Tbsp <strong>salted butter</strong></li>
      <li>2 cups <strong>pecan halves</strong></li>
      <li>1 tsp <strong>vanilla extract</strong></li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups <strong>light strongrown sugar</strong></li>
      <li>1/4 tsp <strong>salt</strong></li>
      <li>
        1 cup <strong>evaporated milk</strong> or <strong>half-and-half</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper and set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        In a medium-size heavy pot, combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar,
        salt, evaporated milk, and butter. Cook and stir with a wooden spoon
        over medium heat until the sugars dissolve and the mixture comes to a
        boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue to cook until the temperature reaches between 235-240Â°F on a
        <u>candy thermometer</u> (soft ball stage). Remove from heat and allow
        the praline mixture to cool for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Stir in the vanilla and pecans, beating by hand with a wooden spoon just
        until the candy begins to lose its glossiness and thickens slightly,
        about 2 minutes. If you beat too long, the candy will seize and start to
        crumble.
        <em
          >If you don't beat it long enough, then pralines won't set properly
          and will stay soft and sticky.</em
        >
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        Work quickly to drop heaping tablespoons (I use a small cookie dough
        scoop) of pecan praline mixture onto the parchment paper-lined baking
        sheet. If the praline mixture begins to harden in the pan, add a
        teaspoon of hot water at a time and stir to keep the mixture loose
        enough to scoop and drop.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Cool completely until set and the pralines have reached room
        temperature. Store in an airtight container on the counter for 2 weeks
        or freeze for up to 2 months.
      </li>
    </ol>
